'''
Instructions :

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

def find_uniq(arr):
    lst = list(set(arr))
    return lst[1] if arr.count(lst[0]) > arr.count(lst[1]) else lst[0]
